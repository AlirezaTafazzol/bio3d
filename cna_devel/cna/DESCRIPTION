Description: The cna package contains functions to process atomic correlation network data. It relies on bio3d, igraph, graph packages and also on VMD-DNA plugin to process the data. Networks are generated starting from an adjacency matrix, the edge betweenness can be calculated with different methods. Community structure analysis can be performed with the girvan-newman algorithm, and the results can be compared.
