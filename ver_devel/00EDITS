Bio3D Version 1-1.6
===================

Based on ver_1-1.5, fix bugs:
1. in ide.filter.R and rmsd.filter.R, calling 
   the function "cutree" in the base package
   "stat" with ".Call" causes problems in R 3.0.0
2. dssp.R, seq2aln.R, seqaln.R, and stride.R 
   don't work properly in Windows; fixed by
   replacing "system" function with "shell"
