Description: The Bio3D package contains utilities to process, organize and
    explore protein structure, sequence and dynamics data.  Features include
    the ability to read and write structure, sequence and dynamic trajectory
    data, perform database searches, data summaries, atom selection,
    re-orientation, alignment, superposition, rigid core identification,
    clustering, torsion analysis, distance matrix analysis, structure and
    sequence conservation analysis, normal mode analysis, and principal
    component analysis (PCA).  In addition, various utility functions are
    provided to enable the statistical and graphical power of the R environment
    to work with biological sequence and structural data.  Please refer to the
    URL below for more information.
