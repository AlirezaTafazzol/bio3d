v2.1
Version 2.1, released in Nov 2014,  contains new facilities for Correlation 
Network Analysis (cna) and Geometrically Stable Domain finding (geostas). 
We have also changed 'PDB object data' storage from a matrix to a data.frame 
format. Improved methods and functionality for ensemble NMA are now also included 
along with extensive improvements to package vignettes and function documentation.

Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>-<patch>

E.g.: 2.0-1

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
