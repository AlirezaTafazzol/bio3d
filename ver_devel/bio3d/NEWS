Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.


v1.2-0
------

* [New functions](https://bitbucket.org/Grantlab/bio3d/wiki/New%20functions)

Highlights include:
* fit.xyz, rmsd, and dccm functions now support multicore
* dccm supports "grpby" argument, which can be used for all-atom cross-correlation calculation
* cmap supports multicore and input of structural ensemble
* read.ncdf supports specifying time range
* core.find, pdbaln, and read.fasta.pdb now support multicore
* read.pdb and split.pdb support multi-model PDB files
* binding.site: Determines the interacting residues between two PDB entities
* read.mol2: Read a Sybyl MOL2 file
* pdb2aln: Align a PDB structure to an existing alignment
* rgyr: Calculation of the radius of gyration
* struct.aln: Alignment of two PDB files with unequal number of atoms (with iterative refinement)
* nma: Calculate coarse grained normal modes (elastic network model)
* dccm.nma, fluct.nma, mktrj.nma, rmsip, overlap: Various analysis of normal modes
* com, com.xyz: Calculate the center of mass of PDB entities
* pdb.annotate: Get customizable annotations for query results from PDB
* dssp, stride: Updated to return sse sequence and work with new version of dssp
* dssp.trj: Run dssp on a trajectory
* bounds: Bug fix
* Rd doc file imporvments
* pdbseq: renamed from previous seq.pdb()
