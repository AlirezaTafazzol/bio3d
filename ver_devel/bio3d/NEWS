Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>-<patch>

E.g.: 2.0-1

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
