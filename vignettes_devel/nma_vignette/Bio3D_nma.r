#' ## Background:
#' Bio3D[^1] is an R package that provides interactive tools for structural bioinformatics. The primary focus of Bio3D is the analysis of bimolecular structure, sequence and simulation data.
#'
#' Normal mode analysis (NMA) is one of the major simulation techniques used to probe large-scale motions in biomolecules. Typical application is for the prediction of functional motions in proteins. Version 2.0 of the Bio3D package now includes extensive NMA facilities. These include a unique collection of multiple elastic network model force-fields (see **Example 1** below), automated ensemble analysis methods (**Example 2**) and variance weighted NMA (**Example 3**). Here we demonstrate the use of these new features with working code that comprise complete executable examples[^2].

#' #### Requirements:
#' Detailed instructions for obtaining and installing the Bio3D package on various platforms can be found in the [**Installing Bio3D Vignette**](http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/download/download.html) available both on-line and from within the Bio3D package. In addition to Bio3D the _MUSCLE_ multiple sequence alignment program (available from the [muscle home page](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/)) must be installed on your system and in the search path for executables. Please see the installation vignette for further details.

#'
#' ## Example 1: Basic Normal Mode Analysis
#' ### Example 1A: Normal mode calculation
#' Normal mode analysis (NMA) of a single protein structure can be carried out by providing a PDB object to the function **nma()**. In the code below we first load the Bio3D package and then download an example structure of hen egg white lysozyme (PDB id *1hel*) with the function **read.pdb()**. Finally the function **nma()** is used perform the normal mode calculation:

#+ example1_A, results="hide"
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hel")
modes <- nma(pdb)

#' A short summary of the returned *nma* object contained within the new variable *modes* can be obtained by simply calling the function **print()**:

print(modes)

#' This reveals the function call resulting in the *nma* object along with the total number of stored normal modes. For PDB id *1hel* there are 129 amino acid residues, and thus $387$ modes ($3*129=387$) in this object. The first six modes are so-called trivial modes with zero frequency and correspond to rigid-body rotation and translation. The frequency of the next six lowest-frequency modes is also printed. 
#' 
#' Note that the returned *nma* object consists of a number of attributes listed on the _+attr:_ line. These attributes contain the detailed results of the calculation and their complete description can be found on the **nma()** functions help page accessible with the command: `help(nma)`. To get a quick overview of the results one can simply call the **plot()** function on the returned *nma* object. This will produce a summary plot of (1) the eigenvalues, (2) the mode frequencies, and (3) the atomic fluctuations (See Figure 1).

#+ fig1_a_1, fig.cap="Summary plot of NMA results for hen egg white lysozyme (PDB id *1hel*). The optional *sse=pdb* argument provided to **plot.nma()** results in a secondary structure schematic being added to the top and bottom margins of the fluctuation plot (helices black and strands gray). Note the larger fluctuations predicted for loop regions." 
plot(modes, sse=pdb)


#'
#' ### Example 1B: Specifying a force field
#' The main Bio3D normal mode analysis function, **nma()**, requires a set of coordinates, as obtained from the **read.pdb()** function, 
#' and the specification of a force field describing the interactions between constituent atoms. By default the *calpha* force field originally
#' developed by Konrad Hinsen is utilized [^3]. This employs a spring force constant differentiating between nearest-neighbor pairs along the 
#' backbone and all other pairs. The force constant function was parameterized by fitting to a local minimum of a crambin model using the 
#' AMBER94 force field. However, a number of additional force fields are also available, as well as functionality for providing customized 
#' force constant functions. Full details of available force fields can be obtained with the command `help(load.enmff)`. 
#' With the code below we briefly demonstrate their usage along with a simple comparison of the modes obtained from two of the most commonly 
#' used force fields: 

#+ help, eval=FALSE
help(load.enmff)
 
#+ example1_B, results="hide"
# Calculate modes with various force fields
modes.a <- nma(pdb, ff="calpha")
modes.b <- nma(pdb, ff="anm")
modes.c <- nma(pdb, ff="pfanm")
modes.d <- nma(pdb, ff="reach")
modes.e <- nma(pdb, ff="sdenm")

#+ example1_B_rmsip
# Root mean square inner product (RMSIP)
r <- rmsip(modes.a, modes.b)

#+ plot_ff-rmsip, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Analysis of mode similarity between modes obtained from the *ANM* and *calpha* force fields by calculating mode overlap and root mean square inner product (RMSIP) with function **rmsip()**. An RMSIP value of *1* depicts identical directionalites of the two mode subspaces. "
# Plot the RMSIP
plot(r, xlab="ANM", ylab="C-alpha FF")

#'
#' ### Example 1C: Normal mode analysis of the GroEL subunit
#' Bio3D includes a number of functions for analyzing and visualizing the normal modes. In the example below we illustrate this functionality
#' on the GroEL subunit. GroEL is a multimeric protein consisting of 14 identical subunits organized in three distinct domains inter-connected
#' by two hinge regions facilitating large conformational changes. 
#' 
#' We will investigate the normal modes through 
#' (**1**) mode visualization to illustrate the nature of the motions; 
#' (**2**) cross-correlation analysis to determine correlated regions; 
#' (**3**) deformation analysis to measure the local flexibility of the structure; and 
#' (**4**) overlap analysis to determine which modes contribute to a given conformational change. 

#'
#' #### Calculate the normal modes
#' In the code below we download a structure of GroEL (PDB-id *1sx4*) and use **atom.select()** to select one of the 14 subunits prior to the call to **nma()**:

#+ example1_C, cache=TRUE, results="hide"
# Download PDB, calcualte normal modes of the open subunit
pdb.full   <- read.pdb("1sx4")
pdb.open   <- trim.pdb(pdb.full, atom.select(pdb.full, chain="A"))
modes      <- nma(pdb.open)

#'
#' #### Mode visualization
#' With Bio3D you can visualize the normal modes either by generating a trajectory file which can be loaded into a molecular viewer program (e.g. VMD or PyMOL), 
#' or through a vector field representation in PyMOL. Both functions, **mktrj.nma()** and **view.modes()**, takes an *nma* object as input in addition to
#' the mode index specifying which mode to visualize:
#' 
#+ example1_C-trj, cache=TRUE, results="hide"
# Make a PDB trajectory
a <- mktrj.nma(modes, mode=7)

# Vector field representation (see Figure 3.)
view.modes(modes, mode=7)

#' ![Visualization of the first non-trivial mode of the GroEL subunit. Visualization is provided through a trajectory file (left), or vector field representation (right).](figure/groel-traj-vector.png)


#'
#' #### Cross-correlation analysis
#' Function **dccm.nma()** calculates the cross-correlation matrix of the *nma* object. Function **plot.dccm()** will draw a correlation map,
#' and 3D visualization of correlations is provided through function **view.dccm()**:
#' 
#+ example1_C-dccm, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, results="hide"
# Calculate the cross-correlation matrix
cm <- dccm(modes)

#+ example1_C-plotdccm, message=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Correlation map revealing correlated and anti-correlated regions in the protein structure."
# Plot a correlation map with plot.dccm(cm)
plot(cm, sse=pdb.open, contour=F, col.regions=bwr.colors(20), at=seq(-1,1,0.1) )

#+ example1_C-viewdccm, cache=TRUE, results="hide"
# View the correlations in the structure (see Figure 5.)
view.dccm(cm, pdb.open)

#' ![Correlated (left) and anti-correlated (right) residues depicted with red and blue lines, respectively. The figures demonstrate the output of function **view.dccm()**.](figure/groel-correl.png)

#'
#' #### Fluctuation and Deformation analysis
#' Deformation analysis provides a measure for the amount of local flexibility in the protein structure - _i.e._ atomic motion relative
#' to neighbouring atoms. It differs from *fluctuations* (_e.g._ RMSF values) which provide amplitudes of the absolute atomic motion.
#' Below we calculate deformation energies (with **deformation.nma()**) and atomic fluctuations (with **fluct.nma()**) of the first three modes and 
#' visualize the results in PyMOL:

#+ example1_C-deform, cache=TRUE, results="hide"
# Deformation energies
defe <- deformation.nma(modes)
defsums <- rowSums(defe$ei[,1:3])

# Fluctuations
flucts <- fluct.nma(modes, mode.inds=seq(7,9))

# Write to PDB files (see Figure 6.)
write.pdb(pdb=NULL, xyz=modes$xyz, file="R-defor.pdb", b=defsums)
write.pdb(pdb=NULL, xyz=modes$xyz, file="R-fluct.pdb", b=flucts)


#' ![Atomic fluctuations (left) and deformation energies (right) visualized in PyMOL.](figure/groel_fluct-deformation.png)

#'                
#' #### Overlap analysis
#' Finally, we illustrate overlap analysis to compare a conformational difference vector with the normal modes to identify 
#' which modes contribute to a given conformational change (i.e. the difference between the open and closed state of the GroEL subunit).

#+ example1_C-overlap, cache=TRUE, results="hide"
# Closed state of the subunit
pdb.closed <- trim.pdb(pdb.full, atom.select(pdb.full, chain="H"))

# Align closed and open PDBs
aln <- struct.aln(pdb.open, pdb.closed, max.cycles=0)
pdb.closed$xyz <- aln$xyz

# Caclulate a difference vector
xyz <- rbind(pdb.open$xyz[aln$a.inds$xyz], pdb.closed$xyz[aln$a.inds$xyz])
diff <- difference.vector(xyz)

# Calculate overlap
oa <- overlap(modes, diff)

#+ plot_groeloverlap, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Overlap analysis between the modes of the open subunit and the conformational difference vector between the closed-open state."
plot(oa$overlap, type='h', xlab="Mode index", ylab="Squared overlap", ylim=c(0,1))
points(oa$overlap, col=1)
lines(oa$overlap.cum, type='b', col=2, cex=0.5)
text(c(1,5)+.5, oa$overlap[c(1,5)], c("Mode 1", "Mode 5"), adj=0)



#'
#' ## Example 2: Ensemble normal mode analysis
#' The analysis of multiple protein structures (e.g. a protein family) can be accomplished with the **nma.pdbs()** function. This will take aligned input structures, as generated by the **pdbaln()** function for example, and perform NMA on each structure collecting the results in manner that facilitates the interoperation of similarity and dissimilarity trends in the structure set. Here we will analyze a collection of protein kinase structures with low sequence identity (Example 2A) and large set of closely related transducin heterotrimeric G protein family members (Example 2B). 

#'
#' ### Example 2A: Protein kinases 
#' In the following code we collect 9 kinase structures from the protein databank (using **get.pdb()**) with sequence identity down to 14% (see the call to function **seqidentity()** below), and align these with **pdbaln()**:

#+ example2_A, cache=TRUE, results="hide", warning=FALSE
# Select Protein Kinase PDB IDs
ids <- c("4b7t_A", "2exm_A", "1opj_A", 
         "4jaj_A", "1a9u_A", "1tki_A", 
         "1phk_A", "1csn_A", "1lp4_A") 

# Download and split by chain ID
raw.files <- get.pdb(ids, path="raw_pdbs")
files     <- pdbsplit( raw.files, ids )

# Alignment of structures
pdbs <- pdbaln(files)

#+ example_2A2
# Sequence identity
summary( c(seqidentity(pdbs)) )

#'
#' The *pdbs* object now contains *aligned* C-alpha atom data, including Cartesian coordinates, residue numbers, 
#' residue types, and B-factors. The sequence alignment is also stored by default to the fasta file 'aln.fa' (to view this you can use an alignment viewer such as SEAVIEW, see _Requirements_ section above).
#' Function **nma.pdbs()** will calculate the normal modes of each protein structures stored in the *pdbs* object. 
#' The normal modes are calculated on the full structures as provided
#' by object *pdbs*. With the default argument `rm.gaps=TRUE` unaligned atoms 
#' are omitted from output in accordance with common practice [^4]. 
#' 

#+ example2_A-modes, cache=TRUE, results="hide", warning=FALSE
# NMA on all structures
modes <- nma.pdbs(pdbs, full=TRUE)

#'
#' The *modes* object of class *enma* contains aligned normal mode data including fluctuations, RMSIP data, and aligned
#' eigenvectors. A short summary of the *modes* object can be obtain by calling the function **print()**, and the aligned 
#' fluctuations can be plotted with function **plot()**:

#+ example2_A-print,
print(modes)

#+ plot_enma1, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Results of ensemble NMA on selected protein kinase superfamily members. "
# Plot fluctuation data
plot(modes, pdbs, type="h")
legend("topleft", legend=ids, col=seq(1,nrow(modes$fluctuations)), lty=1)

#+ example2_A-modes2, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE, results="hide",
# Alternatively, one can use 'rm.gaps=FALSE' to keep the gap containing columns
modes <- nma.pdbs(pdbs, rm.gaps=FALSE)

#'
#' Cross-correlation analysis can be easily performed and the results contrasted for each member of the input ensemble. Below we calculate and plot the correlation matrices for each structure and then output correlations present only in all input structures.
#'

#+ cij_enma3, results="hide", message=FALSE
# Calculate correlation matrices for each structure
cij <- dccm(modes)

#+ plot_enma2, fig.cap="Residue cross-correlations for each kinase structures analyzed."
# Set DCCM plot panel names for combined figure
dimnames(cij$all.dccm)=list(NULL, NULL, ids)
plot.dccm(cij$all.dccm)

#+ plot_enma3, fig.cap="Residue cross-correlations present in all kinase structures analyzed."
# Determine correlations present only in all 9 input structures
#cij.all <- dccm.mean(cij$all.dccm, cutoff.sims=9, cutoff.cij = 0)
#plot.dccm2(cij.all, main="Consensus Residue Cross Correlation")


#'
#' ### Example 2B: Transducin
#' 
#' In this section we will demonstrate the use of **nma.pdbs()** on the example transducin family data that ships with the Bio3D package. This can be loaded with the command _data(transducin)_ and contains an object *pdbs* consisting of aligned C-alpha coordinates for 53 transducin structures from the PDB as well their annotation (in the object *annotation*) as obtained from the **pdb.annotate()** function. Note that this data can be generated from scratch by following the *Comparative Structure Analysis with Bio3D Vignette* available both on-line and from within the Bio3D package.


#+ example2_B-data, cache=FALSE, results="hide"
# Load data
data(transducin)
pdbs <- transducin$pdbs
annotation <- transducin$annotation

# Find gap positions
gaps.res <- gap.inspect(pdbs$ali)
gaps.pos <- gap.inspect(pdbs$xyz)

#+ example2_B-modes, cache=TRUE, results="hide", warning=FALSE
# Calculate normal modes of the 53 structures
modes <- nma.pdbs(pdbs)

#+ example2_B-plot, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Structural dynamics of transducin. The calculation is based on NMA of 53 structures: 28 GTP-bound (red), and 25 GDP-bound (green)."
# Make fluctuation plot
plot(modes, col=annotation[, "color"], pdbs=pdbs)
legend("left", lty=c(1, 1), lwd=c(2, 2),
    col=c("red", "green"), legend=c("GTP", "GDP"))

#' The similarity of structural dynamics is calculated by RMSIP
#' based on the 10 lowest frequency normal modes. The *rmsip* values are pre-calculated in the *modes* object
#' and can be accessed through the attribute `modes$rmsip`.
#' As a comparison, we also calculate the
#' root mean square deviation (RMSD) of all pair-wise structures:

#+ example2_B-rmsip, fig.cap="RMSIP matrix of the transducin family. "
# Plot a heat map with clustering dendogram
ids <- substr(basename(pdbs$id), 1, 6)
heatmap((1-modes$rmsip), labRow=annotation[, "state"], labCol=ids, symm=TRUE)

#+ example2_B-rmsd, cache=TRUE, fig.cap="RMSD matrix of the transducin family."
# Calculate pair-wise RMSD values
rmsd.map <- rmsd(pdbs$xyz, a.inds=gaps.pos$f.inds, fit=TRUE)
heatmap(rmsd.map, labRow=annotation[, "state"], labCol=ids, symm=TRUE)

#'
#' ## Example 3: Variance weighted normal mode analysis
#' In this example we illustrate an approach of weighting the pair force constants based on the variance of the inter atomic distances obtained from an ensemble of structures (e.g. available X-ray structures). The motivation for such variance-weighting is to reduce the well known dependence of the force constants on the one structure upon which they are derived [^5].
#'
#' ### Example 3A: GroEL
#' We first calculate the normal modes of both the closed and open state of the GroEL subunit, and we illustrate 
#' the difference in the agreement towards the observed conformational changes (characterised by X-ray and EM studies). 
#' We will then use an ensemble of X-ray/EM structures as weights to the pair-force constants.

#+ example3_A-pdbs, cache=TRUE, results="hide", warning=FALSE
# Define the ensemble PDB-ids
ids <- c("1sx4_[A,B,H,I]", "1xck_[A-B]", "1sx3_[A-B]", "4ab3_[A-B]")

# Download and split PDBs by chain ID
raw.files <- get.pdb(ids, path = "raw_pdbs", gzip=TRUE)
files <- pdbsplit(raw.files, ids, path = "raw_pdbs/split_chain/")

# Align and superimpose coordinates
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit=TRUE)

#'
#' #### Calculate normal modes
#' Next we will calculate the normal modes of the open and closed conformational state. They are stored at indices 1 and 5, respectively, in our *pdbs* object. 
#' Use the **pdbs2pdb()** to fetch the pdb objects which is needed for the input to **nma()**. 
#'

#+ example3_A-modes, cache=TRUE,
# Inspect gaps
gaps.res <- gap.inspect(pdbs$ali)
gaps.pos <- gap.inspect(pdbs$xyz)

# Access PDB objects
pdb.list   <- pdbs2pdb(pdbs, inds=c(1,5,9), rm.gaps=TRUE)

#'
#' Note that we are here using the argument `rm.gaps=TRUE` to omit residues in gap containing columns of the alignment. 
#' Consequently, the resulting three pdb objects we obtain will have the same lengths (523 residues), which
#' is convenient for subsequent analysis. 

#+ example3_A-pdblist, cache=TRUE, results='hide'
pdb.open   <- pdb.list[["1sx4_A"]]
pdb.closed <- pdb.list[["1xck_A"]]
pdb.rstate <- pdb.list[["4ab3_A"]]

# Calaculate normal modes
modes.open   <- nma(pdb.open)
modes.closed <- nma(pdb.closed)
modes.rstate <- nma(pdb.rstate)

#'
#' #### Overlap analysis
#' Use overlap analysis to determine the agreement between the normal mode vectors and the conformational difference vector:
#'

#+ example3_A-overlap, cache=TRUE,
# Difference vector 1: closed - open
diff.vec.1 <- difference.vector(pdbs$xyz[c(1,5), gaps.pos$f.inds])
# Difference vector 2: closed - rstate
diff.vec.2 <- difference.vector(pdbs$xyz[c(5,9), gaps.pos$f.inds])

# Calculate overlap
oa <- overlap(modes.open,   diff.vec.1)
ob <- overlap(modes.closed, diff.vec.1)
oc <- overlap(modes.closed, diff.vec.2)

#+ example3A_plotoverlap1, fig.width=7, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Overlap anlaysis with function **overlap()**. The modes calculated on the open state of the GroEL subunit shows a high similarity to the conformational difference vector (black), while the agreement is lower when the normal modes are calculated on the closed state (red). Blue line correspond to the overlap between the closed state and the r-state (a semi-open state characterized by a rotation of the apical domain in the oposite direction as compared to the open state."
plot(oa$overlap.cum[1:10], type='b', ylim=c(0,1),
     ylab="Squared overlap", xlab="Mode index",
     cex.lab=1.4, cex.axis=1.2, lwd=2)
lines(ob$overlap.cum[1:10], type='b', lty=2, col=2, lwd=2)
lines(oc$overlap.cum[1:10], type='b', lty=3, col=4, lwd=1)

legend("bottomright",
       c("Open to closed", "Closed to open", "Closed to r-state"),
       col=c(1,2,4), lty=c(1,2,3))

#'
#' #### Variance weighting
#' From the overlap analysis above we see the good agreement (high overlap value) between the conformational difference vector 
#' and the normal modes calculated on the open structures. Contrary, the lowest frequency modes of the closed 
#' structures does not show the same behaviour. We will thus proceed with the weighting of the force constants. 
#' First we'll define a quick function for calculating the weights which takes a matrix of cartesian coordinates 
#' as input:
#'

#+ example3_A-weights, cache=TRUE,
"make.weights" <- function(xyz) {
  # Calculate pairwise distances
  natoms <- ncol(xyz) / 3
  all <- array(0, dim=c(natoms,natoms,nrow(xyz)))
  for( i in 1:nrow(xyz) ) {
    dists <- dist.xyz(xyz[i,])
    all[,,i] <- dists
  }
  
  # Calculate variance of pairwise distances
  all.vars <- apply(all, 1:2, var)
  
  # Make the final weights
  weights <- 1 - (all.vars / max(all.vars))
  return(weights)
}

# Calcualte the weights
wts <- make.weights(pdbs$xyz[, gaps.pos$f.inds])

#' 
#' Weights to the force constants can be included by the argument 'fc.weights' to function **nma()**. 
#' This needs be a matrix with dimensions NxN (where N is the number of C-alpha atoms). Here we will 
#' run a small for-loop with increasing the 
#' strength of the weigthing at each step and store the new overlap values in the variable 'ob.wtd':

#+ example3_A-owtd, cache=TRUE, results="hide"
ob.wtd <- NULL
for ( i in 1:10 ) {
  modes.wtd <- nma(pdb.closed, fc.weights=wts**i)
  ob.tmp    <- overlap(modes.wtd,    diff.vec.1)
  ob.wtd    <- rbind(ob.wtd, ob.tmp$overlap.cum)
}

#+ example3A_plotoverlap2, fig.width=7, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Overlap plot with increasing strength on the weighting. The final weighted normal modes of the closed subunit shows as high overlap values as the modes for the open state."
plot(oa$overlap.cum[1:10], type='b', ylim=c(0,1),
     ylab="Squared overlap", xlab="Mode index",
     cex.lab=1.4, cex.axis=1.2, axes=T, lwd=2)
lines(ob$overlap.cum[1:10], type='b', lty=2, col=1, lwd=2)

cols <- rainbow(10)
for ( i in 1:nrow(ob.wtd) ) {
  lines(ob.wtd[i,1:10], type='b', lty=1, col=cols[i])
}

legend("bottomright",
       c("Open state", "Closed state", "Closed state (weighted)"),
       col=c("black", "black", "green"), lty=c(1,2,1))


#'
#' #### RMSIP calculation
#' RMSIP can be used to compare the mode subspaces:
#+ example3_A-rmsip, cache=TRUE
ra <- rmsip(modes.open, modes.wtd)
rb <- rmsip(modes.open, modes.closed)


#+ example3A_plot-rmsip, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.cap="RMSIP maps between (un)weighted normal modes obtained from the open and closed subunits."
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(ra, ylab="NMA(open)", xlab="NMA(weighted)")
plot(rb, ylab="NMA(open)", xlab="NMA(closed)")

#'
#' #### Match with PCA
#' Finally, we compare the calculated normal modes with principal components obtained from the ensemble of X-ray
#' structures using function **pca.xyz()**:

#+ example3_A-pca, cache=TRUE
# Calculate the PCs
pc.xray <- pca.xyz(pdbs$xyz[,gaps.pos$f.inds])

# Calculate RMSIP values
rmsip(pc.xray, modes.open)$rmsip
rmsip(pc.xray, modes.closed)$rmsip
rmsip(pc.xray, modes.rstate)$rmsip
rmsip(pc.xray, modes.wtd)$rmsip


#'
#' ### Example 3B: Transducin
#' 
#' This example will run **nma()** on transducin with variance weighted force constants. 
#' The modes predicted by NMA will be compared with principal component analysis (PCA) results over the transducin family.
#' We load the transducin data via the command _data(transducin)_ and 
#' calculate the normal modes for two structures corresponding to two nucleotide states, respectively:
#' GDP (PDB id 1TAG) and GTP (PDB id 1TND). Again we use function **pdbs2pdb()** to build the *pdb* objects
#' from the *pdbs* object (containing aligned structure/sequence information). The coordinates of the data set were
#' fitted to all non-gap containing C-alpha positions. 
#+ example3_B-data, cache=FALSE,
data(transducin)
pdbs <- transducin$pdbs

gaps.res <- gap.inspect(pdbs$ali)
gaps.pos <- gap.inspect(pdbs$xyz)

#+ PCA-transducin, cache=TRUE
# Fit coordinates based on all non-gap positions
# and do PCA
xyz <- pdbfit(pdbs)
pc.xray <- pca.xyz(xyz[, gaps.pos$f.inds])

#+ example3_B-modes, cache=TRUE, results="hide", 
# Fetch PDB objects
npdbs <- pdbs
npdbs$xyz <- xyz
pdb.list <- pdbs2pdb(npdbs, inds=c(2, 7), rm.gaps=TRUE)
pdb.gdp <- pdb.list[[ grep("1TAG_A", names(pdb.list)) ]]
pdb.gtp <- pdb.list[[ grep("1TND_B", names(pdb.list)) ]]

# Calculate normal modes
modes.gdp <- nma(pdb.gdp)
modes.gtp <- nma(pdb.gtp)

#' Now, we calculate the pairwise distance variance based on the structural ensemble with the function 
#' **make.weights()** defined above. This will be used to weight the force constants in the elastic network model. 
#+ example3_B-weights, cache=TRUE, results='hide'
# Calculate weights 
weights <- make.weights(xyz[, gaps.pos$f.inds])
