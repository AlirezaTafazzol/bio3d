# Features

Features include the ability to read and write structure, sequence and dynamic trajectory data, perform database searches, atom summaries, atom selection, re-orientation, superposition, rigid core identification, clustering, torsion analysis, distance matrix analysis, structure and sequence conservation analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA).  

In addition, various utility functions are provided to enable the statistical and graphical power of the R environment to work with biological sequence and structural data.  Please refer to the main `Bio3D website` at http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/ for more background information.

The Bio3D package consists of input/output functions, conversion and manipulation functions, analysis functions, and graphics functions which are summarized below with links to further documentation including example results. Remember that you can also get help on any particular function by using the command `?function` or `help(function)` from within R itself.
